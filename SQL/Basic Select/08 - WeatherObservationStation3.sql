-- Problem Statement
/*
Given a table STATION that holds data for five fields; ID, CITY, STATE, LAT_N and LONG_W.
+-------------+-------------+
| Field       |   Type      |
+-------------+-------------+
| ID          | NUMBER      |
| CITY        | VARCHAR2(21)|
| STATE       | VARCHAR2(2) |
| LAT_N       | NUMBER      |
| LONG_W      | NUMBER      |
+-------------+-------------+

Query a list of CITY names from STATION with even ID numbers only. You may print the results in any order, but must exclude duplicates from your answer.
*/

SELECT DISTINCT CITY FROM STATION WHERE Mod(ID, 2)=0;
